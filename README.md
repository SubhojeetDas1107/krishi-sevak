#### Context:
>India is a farming country. India is one of the major players in the agriculture sector worldwide and it is the primary source of livelihood for about 58% of India’s population. But India lacks actual scientific farming. This is due to the lack of access to scientific training and methods to the farmers. Scientific farming is a necessity in India, as it is the only way to ensure that the country’s agricultural sector can keep up with the ever-increasing demand for food. India is home to over 1.3 billion people, and with a population growth rate of 1.2%, it is estimated that by 2050, India will be home to 1.7 billion people. This means that the demand for food will continue to increase, and if India does not adopt scientific farming practices, it will be unable to meet this demand. So the adoption of scientific methods and modern approaches towards farming is extremely necessary.
#### Proposal:
>So, we propose KrishiSevak. KrishiSevak is a web app that guides farmers with proper scientific advice and recommendations using the power of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The farmer can simple open the website, fill in some details and allow location access. KrishiSevak suggests the most profitable and suitable crops to grow at the season, recommend pesticides necessary. If multiple crops can be cultivated, KrishiSevak will calculate annual profit on all possible crops based on the market price and present all the possible farming paths that can be taken in a dashboard format.
KrishiSevak would use machine learning algorithms to analyze data from various sources such as weather forecasts, soil conditions, crop prices, and other relevant information. It would then provide farmers with insights and tips on how to best manage their farms.
